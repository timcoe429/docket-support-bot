It allows both beginners and advanced users to create visually appealing and responsive designs without needing to know how to code. This is what is used to edit your website.</li><li><strong>Widgets:</strong> In Elementor, widgets, also referred to as an 'element', are the basic building blocks used to add content and functionality to your pages. Examples include text boxes, image galleries, buttons, forms, and more.</li><li><strong>Sections:</strong> Sections are the largest building blocks in Elementor, used to organize your content horizontally.</li><li><strong>Columns:</strong> Columns are sub-divisions within sections, used to organize widgets vertically or in a grid.</li><li><strong>Responsive Mode:</strong> A feature that allows you to design and customize your website's layout for different device types—desktop, tablet, and mobile.</li><li><strong>Z-Index:</strong> Controls the stacking order of elements. Elements with a higher Z-Index value will appear in front of those with lower values.</li><li><strong>Padding & Margin:</strong> Padding is the space inside an element, between the content and its border. Margin is the space outside an element, between it and other elements.</li></ul>",
